# Dossier_app

App for keeping track of everyone you know! But this way, you get to keep the data you make and it's not a social app for other people to view. Easily download whatever data you created into a .csv file from the admin page. This is your little black book, diary and notebook all in one. Easily customizeable and built for mobile first. Search bar only for the Dossier app, but is easily added to the other apps. 

Build with Django 2.2 backend framework, with the built in Django ORM to handle the lightweight SQLite3 database and simple Bootstrap4 UI.
